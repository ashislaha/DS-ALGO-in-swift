 You will start from 0th number and you have to reach to some other number (+ve or -ve),
 But you can take ith Step(any direction either +ve or -ve) at ith move. How many moves do you need to reach destination ?
 
 Example :  destination = +2 ( 0 -> +1 (step = 1) -> -1 (step = 2) -> +2 (step = 3)) #moves = 3
            destination = -2 ( 0 -> -1 (step = 1) -> +1 (step = 2) -> -2 (step = 3)) #moves = 3
            destination = 4 (0 -> -1 -> -3 -> 0 -> 4)
 
 It is same for any +ve or -ve number destination.
