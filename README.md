# DS-ALGO-in-swift
Solving DS-ALGO problems using swift language in play-ground. Problems regarding on Tree, Graph, Linked-list, Greedy-Algo, 
Dynamic Programming etc...

A. Tree Problems :

1. BST Insertion
2. BST Deletion 
3. kth Smallest Element in BST 
4. Is Binary tree a BST 
5. Least Common Ancestor(lca) between 2 nodes in a BST. 
6. Inorder Successor and Inorder Predecessor of a node in BST
7. Print BST nodes within a specific range 
8. Convert a sorted array into BST 
9. Vertical Printing of a tree (using the horizontal distance from root concept)
10. Create BST from preorder traversal
11. Print Boundary of a binary tree both clockwise & anti-clockwise. ( Leaves, Left view, Right View of BT )
12. Create a binary tree from PreOrder and Inorder traversal array
13. Create a Double Linked List from Binary tree in inorder fashion.
14. Mirror of a Binary Tree
15. Create a Balanced BST from a Normal BST 
16. Delete the elemenent having level value less than k.
17. Sum of all leaf nodes in a binary tree.
18. Find Min Height of a binary tree.
19. Top View of a binary tree
20. Closest leaf node from a node in a binary tree
21. Level wise tree traversal using Queue.


B. Heap :

1. Heap Sort 
2. Heap operations (insertion , deletion , decreaseKey, ExtractMin, heapify, createHeap)


C. Linked List :

1. Reverse a linked list.

D. Dynamic Programing :

1. Gold-mine problem 
2. Word Break Problem.
3. Maximum priting of A using 4 keys ( A, Select_all, Copy, Paste )
4. Min Cost Path in a given cost matrix. (allowed direction right, corner, down)
5. Longest increasing subsequence.
6. Gas station Problem.

E. Array :

1. Left Rotation.
2. An Array (say arr2) is a subset of another array (say arr1) - using hash-table 
3. Array elements pair is summed to a given number (x) - using hash-table.
4. Array contains Duplicate elements within k distance - Brute Forece approach & Hash-table approach.
5. Symmetric pairs present in an array or not - using Hash-table O(arr.size)
6. Common elements in 3 sorted array.

Array Test 2 : Consecutive Sum of a number and subarray sum of a given array.

G. Graph :

1. DFS (Depth First Search) of connected / disconnected Graph 
2. BFS (Breadth First Search) of graph 
3. Topological Sorting in a Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG).

H. Ladder and Snake Game using Graph traversal (BFS)

I. Trie 

1. JSON Creation from array of string input.
2. Trie Insertion, Search, Delete

J. Recursion :

1. Minimum steps to reach a number from 0. (can move ith step at ith iteration)

K. Meeting scheduling problem: This is same kind of Job scheduling problem. Given input json and you have find out the conflicted meetings and then proritize as per rule : 
(1). Highest priority if you are the organiser of the meeting schedule. 
(2). No of attendies of each meeting. Give more priority on more attendies meeting.

L. stack operations based on some pre-defined condition.
